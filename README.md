This project was created to satisfy my interest in making a GUI using SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) library.
The project was ment to be a test project to see how a GUI, sound and mousecontrol could be done using SDL.

The program was developed in Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2012.
SDL 1.2.15 library was included in the project.


Instructions for installation:

  1. Clone project to the desktop.
  2. Open project vith Visual Studio (with SDL set up).
  3. Make a build.
  4. Run program from "Memory-game-master\Debug\SDL_laiva".
